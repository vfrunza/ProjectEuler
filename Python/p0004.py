#Problem 0004 - Largest Palindrome Product
#===============================================================================
#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#Answer: 906609
